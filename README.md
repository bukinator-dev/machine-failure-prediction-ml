# machine-failure-prediction-ml
This project focuses on predictive maintenance using machine learning and AI to detect machine failures from vibration data. The primary goal is to analyze vibration signals from main journal bearings in internal combustion engines under diverse climatic and varying operating conditions. By leveraging this data, we aim to reduce downtime and enable data-driven, transparent maintenance decisions.
